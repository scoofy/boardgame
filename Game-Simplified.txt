	Step 2: deal decks
		Stage 1: decks separated into 3 stacks: movement, does nothing, and action cards.
		Stage 2: players each draw a random deck of movement, does nothing, and action cards.
			a way to do this is to put decks in random deck boxes, then "shuffle" the boxes up, or put the boxes in a hat and have players reach in for each.
			then: players casually shuffle action and do nothing cards together (order not particularly important).
