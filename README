This is a board game i've been working on.

Plot:
The president is about to make a speech, but something is amiss.

Two players play as a Secret Service agent and Undercover Police Officer, and attempt to save the president. Unless, though rarely, the police officer is working with the enemy.

Two others are assassins, each with their own specialties, attempting to kill the president and escape.

However, nobody knows who anyone else is, until they reveal themselves.

Some will survive, others will die, but only one will win.
